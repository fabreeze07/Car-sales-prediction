# Car-sales-prediction
This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model capable of predicting the sale price of used cars, based on various vehicle characteristics. The main goal is to provide a useful tool for both buyers and sellers, allowing them to estimate a car's value more accurately in the current market.

#Project goal

- Data Cleaning and Transformation: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing/standardizing numerical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Interactive visualizations to discover patterns, distributions, and correlations.
- Feature Engineering: Creation of new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
- Predictive Modeling: Implementation and evaluation of algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, among others.
- Model Evaluation: Metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and R 
  2 (R-squared) to quantify model accuracy.
